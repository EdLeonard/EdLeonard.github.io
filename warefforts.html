            the art center across the road from Christ College. This match ended 34-0 to Christ's and to this day stands
            as their largest win ever. After this the match became an annual event only not going ahead in dire
            cricumstances. Boys' High has since one 84 out of the 136 games with College winning 43 and 9 ending in
            draws.</p>
