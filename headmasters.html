            The headmaster's of CBHS date back to the beginning of the school in 1881 with the founding headmaster being Dr. Thomas Nolan Miller. He served as for two years and was the first of many respectable headmasters that would run the school in years to come. Mr A.E. Caddick and Mr C.F.S Caldwell who have both had school facilities named in honour of them. Both blocks recently rebuilt.
