                    <p>
                        An ANZAC service is held in the original 'big room' to commemorate the school's losses of World War One. In turn it was said the headmaster of the time Mr C.E Bevan-Brown would read out the names of Old Boys who had died fighting in World War One, and even become very emotionally moved talking about these losses.
